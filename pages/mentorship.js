          <h1>How the Mentorship Program Works</h1>

          <p>
            The traditional version of our mentorship program matches succesful
            applicant with an industry professional who will mentor them for
            6-12 weeks. The length of the mentorship depends on the availability
            of the mentor. Along with a mentor, the mentee is assigned to an
            open source project that they will be contributing to. This will
            allow the mentee to gain experience in the field, give back to their
            community and utilize what they are learning.

              A successful applicant is a community member that applies,
              meets all
              the minimum requirements and is sent an e-mail of acceptance.
              Applicants normally know within 2-3 weeks if they have been
              accepted or not. As this is a community driven program with
              working
              professionals in the industry, we unfortunately cannot guarantee
              everyone a mentor.
